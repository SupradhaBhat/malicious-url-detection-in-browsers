# malicious-url-detection-in-browsers
This is my version of the open source browser Mozart with a new feature added. This version provides protection against malicious urls. It can detect malicious urls based on risk scores, using a Reputataion score based detector API from APIVoid.com.
CLone the repository and run Mozart.py
